    "The Constitution of East Palmyra Christian School \n     Preamble \n    Believing that the Scriptures have given us the basis for/and the mandate to provide Christian education for our children, we do hereby make and accept the following articles of association, to wit: \n\n    Article 1: Name \n    This organization shall be known as the East Palmyra Christian School, Inc. \n    Article 2: Basis \n    The basis of the organization is the infallible Word of God, the Bible, interpreted in accordance with the doctrinal standards of the Reformed Churches, ie the Canons of Dort, Belgic Confession, and the Heidelberg Catechism. The organization is committed to the following fundamental principles. \n    That the instruction and education of the children in the school as well as in the home, must be in accordance with the will of God, \n    That a school is not an institution depending on/or belonging to the church and/or state, but it depends on and proceeds from the home, \n    That throughout the course of the child's education the fundamental unity of the school and the home must be maintained. \n    Article 3: Statement of Faith \n    The following is the foundation of beliefs on which East Palmyra Christian School is based. They are also the key elements of Christianity that will be unapologetically taught, and adhered to, in various ways through all grade levels. \n    We believe the Bible alone to be the Word of God, the ultimate and infallible authority for faith and practice. \n    We believe that there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. He is omnipotent; that is, He can do all things. He is omnipresent; that is, He is present to all creation, and has under His immediate authority all things which are in Heaven, in the earth, and under the earth. He is omniscient; that is, He knows all things. He readily exercises His power which is present everywhere, and to Him there is nothing that is impossible or unknown, that is, He knows what has been from eternity, what now takes place everywhere, and what will be to all eternity. \n    We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death through His shed blood, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal return in power and glory. \n    We believe that, for the salvation of lost and sinful men, regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely necessary. \n    We believe that salvation is by grace through faith alone. \n    We believe that faith without works is dead. \n    We believe in the present ministry of the Holy Spirit, by whose indwelling the Christian is enabled to live a godly life. \n    We believe in the resurrection of both the saved and the lost; they that are saved to the resurrection of life, and they that are lost to the resurrection of damnation. \n    We believe in the spiritual unity of all believers in our Lord Jesus Christ. \n    We believe that God wonderfully and immutably created each person as distinctly male or female (Gen. 1:26-31; 2:18-25; 5:1, 2). These two distinct and complementary sexes together reflect the image and nature of God. To reject one's biological sex is a rejection of the image of God within that person and is a sin against God. \n    We believe that marriage was created and sanctioned by God in which God joins one man and one woman in a single and exclusive union. (Gen. 2:24; Matt. 19:4-6) \n    We believe that God intends sexual intimacy to occur only between a man and a woman who are married to each other. Any form of sexual intimacy outside of marriage is immoral and is a sin against God. (1 Cor. 6:15-7:6; Eph. 5:3-7) Sexual immorality includes, but is not limited to adultery, fornication, homosexual conduct, and pornography. \n    The statement of faith does not exhaust the extent of our beliefs. The Bible itself, as the inspired and infallible Word of God that speaks with final authority concerning truth, morality, and the proper conduct of mankind, is the sole and final source of all that we believe. For purposes of East Palmyra Christian School's faith, doctrine, practice, policy and discipline, our Board of Trustees is the East Palmyra Christian School's final interpretative authority on the Bible's application. \n    Article 4: Purpose \n    The purpose of the organization is to provide to the youth of the community that weekday instruction which is in agreement with Article 2 and 3 and which is necessary if they, as children of God, are to occupy their places worthily in church, society, and state. \n    Article 5: Membership \n    Section 1\n    Requirements for voting members of the Society of the East Palmyra Christian School, Inc are as follows: \n    Agrees that the basis of the organization is as described in Article 2 \n    Agrees to all of the Statements of Belief in Article 3 \n    Is 18 years of age or older \n    Contributes time, talent or treasure towards the school within the last two years. (e) Having received a majority vote of approval by the Board will be recommended to the Society. \n    Section 2\n    The East Palmyra Christian School Board of Trustees, with a majority vote, will review and recommend to the Society the updated membership list. \n    Article 6: Meeting \n    Section 1 \n    The annual meeting of the organization shall be held during the month of May. The Board shall determine the exact date, time and place. At the annual meeting the Secretary of the Board shall render a report of the activity and the progress of the school the past year. The Treasurer or President shall make a report of the activity status of the school, and the annual election of the Board members shall take place. \n    Section 2 \n    In addition to the annual meeting as many other meetings as the Board deems necessary shall be held, time and place to be determined by the Board. \n    Section 3 \n    Notice of all meetings shall be given by letter or announcement at least three days prior to the meeting. When such notice has been given, those members who appear at the time and place specified shall constitute a quorum. \n    Section 4 \n    All decisions concerning election of Trustees and pertaining to persons shall be by ballot, other decisions may be made by oral vote unless otherwise decided at the meeting. \n    Section 5 \n    The majority (that is, half of the votes cast plus one) shall rule in all cases, except where otherwise required by this Constitution or by Roberts' Rules of Order. \n    Article 7: Board of Trustees \n    Section 1 \n    A Board of Trustees consisting of 9 persons shall be chosen by the organization at its annual meeting from its membership as outlined in Section 5. The term of office for Trustees is three years. Each succeeding year three Trustees shall retire. \n    Section 2 \n    Trustees may serve two consecutive three-year terms after which Trustees are not eligible for re-election for one year. \n    Section 3 \n    Vacancies occurring during the year shall be filled by the Board of Trustees at its next regular meeting. People filling vacancies will fill only the remainder of the term left by the departing Trustee. \n    Section 4 \n    The Board of Trustees shall meet at least once a month. \n    Article 8: Duties of the Board of Trustees \n    The Board of Trustees shall perform the following duties: \n    Following the Constitution of the organization, determine the major school policies. \n    Select a principal, support and teaching staff which is qualified to carry out the education policies of the school. \n    Verify through regular (or monthly) visits to the school that the education policies are duly carried out. \n    Devise ways and means for obtaining the necessary funds for operating the school and how these funds shall be distributed. \n    Through committees, public meetings, promotional literature, and other means, promote the cause of Christian education in the nearby communities. \n    Appoint out of its Board membership such committees as it may deem necessary for the performance of its duties. Such appointments shall be made annually by the Board. The Board may also appoint individuals to act as advisors to each committee. \n    For purposes of East Palmyra Christian School's faith, doctrine, practice, policy and discipline, our Board of Trustees is the East Palmyra Christian School's final interpretive authority on the Bible's application. \n    Article 9: Officers of the Board and Their Duties \n    Section 1 \n    At its first meeting, after each annual meeting of the Organization, the Board shall elect out if its midst the following officers; President, Vice-president, Secretary, and Treasurer. These officers shall serve for one year. \n    Section 2 \n    It shall be the duty of the President to preside at all meetings of the Board and of the organization, and to enforce the rules and regulations of the Constitution. The President is an ex-officio member of all committees and shall be notified of all meetings. \n    Section 3 \n    The Vice-president shall assist the President whenever possible in the discharge of his duties, in the absence of the President the Vice-president shall take his place. \n    Section 4 \n    The Secretary shall take care of the official documents of the organization, and shall conduct all correspondence and enter it into the records of the organization and Board after they have been approved. \n    Section 5 \n    The Treasurer is entrusted with receipts and disbursements of the organization's funds. All monies received shall be deposited in the name of the organization in a financial institution approved by the Board. Disbursements shall be made by check or by electronic means. \n    Financial reports shall be made by the Treasurer or an appointed representative regarding the finances of the organization at the monthly meetings of the Board and at the annual meeting of the organization. \n    Article 10: Procedure Order of Board of Trustees \n    Devotions including Scripture reading \n    Prayer \n    Roll Call \n    Reading of the minutes of previous meeting \n    Report of the Principal \n    Report of the Treasurer \n    Report of the various committees \n    Consideration of unfinished business \n    Consideration of new business \n    Adjournment and closing with prayer \n    Article 11: Staff \n    Section 1 \n    All staff shall be appointed by the Board after careful consideration of their character, training, and other qualifications. They shall be appointed for such terms and upon such salary and other conditions (except as herein expressly provided), as the Board may determine from time to time. Appointments will be accomplished through annual contracts. \n    Section 2 \n    All members of the staff must declare their unconditional acceptance of the basis and purpose of the organization as expressed in Articles 2 and 3 of this Constitution. They must be members of a church whose doctrine is in agreement with the Apostles Creed, Nicene Creed and Athanasian Creed. They must be scripturally sound in their teachings and lead a Christian life as previously defined. \n    Section 3 \n    The Board also reserves the right, in case a contract for the following year is offered to staff, to require the teacher to make a decision on it at time specified by the Board. In the case of a staff member who proves unfit for the work, whose instruction conflicts with the basis and purpose of the organization, or who does not lead a Christian life, as previously defined, the Board reserves the right for immediate dismissal. \n    Section 4 \n    A course of study shall be prepared by the Principal and the Education Committee. After approval by the Board all teachers shall strictly adhere to such a course of study. \n    Section 5 \n    The school term shall be determined by the Board and which holidays and vacations shall be allowed may be decided upon from time to time by the Board. \n    Section 6 \n    The substance of this article shall be made a part of all contracts entered into with members of the staff. \n    Article 12: Amendments \n    The Constitution may be amended by a two-thirds vote at any regular meeting of the organization, provided that two weeks' previous notice has been sent to each member stating the desired changes. Articles 2 and 3 of this Constitution, however, may never be changed. \n    Article 13: Dissolution of the Organization \n    In case of dissolution of the organization, the property and monies belonging to the organization as a body shall be donated after liquidation, to a Christian educational organization determined by a majority vote of the Society. However, as long as ten members of the organization wish to continue the organization may not be dissolved. ",

{"policy": 4042, "title": "Dress Code", "content": "School clothing must be neat, clean, in good repair, and in good taste. Even as there is appropriate clothing for the beach and gym class, so too there is appropriate clothing for school. Good taste would prohibit immodest attire which is too short, skimpy, or tight. In all cases, the appropriateness of any clothing and grooming will be measured by the staff's standards and not by the student's standards. \n Parents are encouraged to help students learn what is appropriate dress for school. Students should remember that their dress reflects their Christian witness and should not detract from the learning environment, particularly because attitudes and behavior can be influenced by clothing. If you have any questions see the FAQ section below or have a conversation with the principal.\n The following are not acceptable:\n 1. Shirts with inappropriate slogans/images\n 2. Tube tops, tank tops, crop tops, half shirts, or any shirt with straps less than 3 inches wide\n 3. Hats and hoods on in the school building\n 4. Leggings, yoga pants, etc. that are not covered by a top that falls at or slightly above the knee or shorts that comply with the inseam rule.\n 5. Skirts that do not go to the knee\n 6. *Shorts with an inseam less than 7 inches\n 7. Exposed midriffs, belly buttons, cleavage, and underwear\n 8. Piercings except for standard gauge ear piercings\n 9. Open toed shoes (Flip flops, etc)\n 10. Slippers/Pajamas - Bedroom, Household, Onesies, Crocs.\n Young girls wearing skirts/dresses should always wear something underneath them, no matter the length (Grades Prek-2).\n *In the case of an organized athletic team and Lap-a-thon, an inseam less than 7 inches is acceptable but not less than 5 inches. \n The dress code is in effect during any school function. Students who violate the dress code must correct their appearance as soon as practical. \n To be sure, these standards are somewhat relative. Nevertheless, the judgment of the staff of the school, and particularly that of the principal, will be used to assure that the improper grooming of a student does not reflect negatively upon the image of EPCS and does not negatively influence the attitude of any student toward him/herself as image-bearer of God or toward those in authority over him/her.

We understand that the loveliness and nobility enjoined by the apostle involve more than just spiritual truths, and that our duty as a school includes the discipline of aesthetic education.\n We therefore affirm that the triune God contains within Himself all ultimate loveliness and beauty. As His creatures, therefore, we are to serve and worship Him in all that we do in the beauty of holiness. He has created us in His own image, and requires us to strive to imitate Him in all that we do, and this includes the duty of understanding our responsibilities of appreciating and creating objects of loveliness.\n We seek to teach the importance of aesthetic standards in all activities associated with the school, striving for that form of excellence suitable to each activity. This obviously includes a strong emphasis throughout our curriculum on the fine arts--music, drawing, painting, drama, poetry-with the attendant responsibilities of the students including study, meditation, and memorization. But our emphasis on aesthetics also extends to more mundane matters -- the cleanliness and decoration of classrooms, student dress, athletic competition, handwriting, etc. In all this, we aim to teach our students the reasons for what we require, and not just impose the bare requirement.

We seek to provide an opportunity for these students to develop and use their God-given ability. We believe that an extra-curricular activities program enhances the atmosphere of the East Palmyra Christian student body, providing students and parents with an opportunity to express positive school spirit. We also recognize that extra-curricular activities provide an opportunity to make the programs established at East Palmyra Christian School known to the broader community of Wayne and Ontario Counties. All extra-curricular activities must conform to established East Palmyra Christian philosophy and standards, excepting those activities under cooperative programs wherein East Palmyra Christian School does not have unilateral authority. Extracurricular activities will not take priority over the academic program at East Palmyra Christian School.\n We desire the older athletes to model godly, biblical principles to the younger students in order to glorify God through their abilities and attitudes. Then to further glorify Him through their relationships with other teammates, coaches, and spectators. We desire our athletes to act humbly on the court, on the field, and on the track. We aim for them to consciously prepare themselves, through athletic rigor, to become successful children of God in their future vocations. We want to instill in our athletes an attitude of sacrifice on and off the field of competition. We want them to diminish the importance of the following when compared to their concern for others: \"How many points did I score?\" \"How much better am I than others on the team?\" \"How much playing time did I get? \"Do I get to play the role that I want on the team?\" \"Am I having fun?\" \"Does this warm-up music pump me up?\" \"Do I look cool?\" Sacrifice may mean: not playing as much as you wanted.

First, EPCS may not in good conscience materially cooperate in activities or promote beliefs contrary to its faith (2 Cor. 6:14; 1 Thess. 5:22). Second, EPCS must present a consistent public witness to the community through its stewardship of its property.
